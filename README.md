================

a html5/js only board game about democracy and hippie villages, this was my js-learning project so go easy on me for my messy code.

* You can play with up to 3 friends or against an AI that can beat an 5 Year Old.
* All the graphics are self drawn.

I played this adorable board game with some Children. And I wanted to play it again, but couldn't remember the name of the game, so I decided to just recreate something similar.

You are a wild Hippie somewhere in the Wood and you and your tribe started to build infrastructure, and are starting to place the roads rivers and hedges which are needed to have a proper village. Decide together how to do that, but be careful in the end you have to make sure your hidden agenda to protect one building type from being torn down by the construction workers, while most others are gone.

So you see, competition makes a crappy village but can be a lot of fun.

    <h2> How to Play </h2>
    <p>
      first you have to choose how many players and which of them computer
      players you want.<br>
      click Play and you land on the board.
      Each Player is a fan of one of the building types
      <img src="pic/fire.png" alt="fire">
      <img src="pic/tipi.png" alt="tipi">
      <img src="pic/bathtub.png" alt="bathtub">
      <img src="pic/shrine.png" alt="shrine">, to find out which one you are,
      click your name in the pannel while no one looks ;)<br>

      While your infrastructure grows, you can, will and should build over the
      buildings and tear them down.<br>
      but <img src="pic/tree.png" alt="tree">  are indefeasible and holy,
      they are barriers
    </p>
    <p>
      below your name you can see a table of the three types of ways and the
      length in fields, the numbers represent the amount of building projects of
      that type and that length you can suggest.
    <div width=80>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td></td>

          <th class="steps_amount_div">

              </table>
            </div>
            and below this table you will find a table with your votest,<br>
            you can vote for and against with up to three fingers displying the
              strength of your opinion,<br>
            But each opinion strength can only be used once per game,
            except the zero fingers, which represent abstention.
          </p>
          <h3> making a move </h3>
          <p>
            when it's your move, grab the mouse, and click one of the building troopers
            <img src="pic/building_troop.png" alt="Building Trooper">, and possible moves are shown
            in the blue circles. Once you click it a window apperas, if any player wants to vote
             hit Space or click the window
          </p>
          <h3> Voting </h3>
          <p> You decided to Vote, and you see a list of the Players Names,
            once one of you clicks on one of the Hands <img src="pic/vote_1.png" alt="Hand">
            a raised arm is shown, next to that players name, indicating that
            this player gave a votum. Once each player voted the result is shown,
            and depending on that the trooper is moving over the board and/or
            it's the next players turn
          </p>
          <h3> Goal </h3>
          <p>
            Each Building of your type Yields points depending on it's size,
             the bigger the better <br>
             The Player with the most points wins.<br>
             So protect your own buildings by making clever moves that make it
             impossible for your oponents to reach them and use your right to
             vote to either distract or prevent damage to your favorite building
             type.
          </p>

          <h2> Have a lot of Fun</h2>
          <p>
            you can change board size and other variables if you like from the
            menu<br>
            there is also a savegame feature, which is not realy neccesary,
            since it takes about 10min to play the game.
            And other stuff.
          </p>
